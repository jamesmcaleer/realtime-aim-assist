# Real-Time Aim Assist using PyAutoGUI

## Overview

Welcome to the Real-Time Aim Assist project! This Python script leverages the PyAutoGUI library to provide users with a real-time aim assist tool for gaming. The aim assist works by capturing screenshots at high speed and employing image recognition techniques to detect players, assisting the user in aiming more effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before using the aim assist tool, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher): [Python Installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- PyAutoGUI: Install using `pip install pyautogui`

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-aim-assist.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd real-time-aim-assist
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the aim assist script:

   ```bash
   python aim_assist.py
   ```

2. Launch your game and position the aim assist window appropriately.

3. The script will start capturing screenshots and providing aim assistance in real-time.

## Configuration

You can customize the aim assist behavior by modifying the configuration parameters in the `config.py` file. Adjust settings such as:

- **Screenshot Interval**: Set the time delay between consecutive screenshots.
- **Detection Threshold**: Fine-tune the detection sensitivity for player recognition.
- **Aim Assist Strength**: Adjust the strength of the aim assist.

## Important Notes
